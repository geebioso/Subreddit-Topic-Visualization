# Subreddit-Topic-Visualization

## Synopsis 
This code repository generates a d3 graph with meantal health subreddits as nodes and links as topics that are shared between subreddits. I used an unsupervised topic model to generate a set of 100 topics and computed which topics were likely to be expressed in each subreddit. Links represent topics that are likely to be expressed in two subreddits. 

## Example 

The code should run at: link. 

## Running the code

cd into the repository
start a localhost server using the command : python -m SimpleHTTPServer
then fun the file graphtest2.html in you browser by entering the url
http://localhost8000/graphtest2.html
